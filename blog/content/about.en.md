## Hello

My name is **Lucas Stofaleti**, and I am originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Currently, I work as a **DevOps Engineer** at ASML and live in the Netherlands.

I am passionate about technology and, particularly, the DevOps world. I have a passion for continuous delivery and infrastructure automation, and I have had the opportunity to work in various types of companies, from startups to state-owned companies.

As a big advocate for **open-source** technology, I believe it is a powerful tool for bridging the gap between people and companies. Here on my blog, I aim to share my experiences and learnings in this field, as well as discuss trends and innovative solutions.

If you're interested in technology, especially the DevOps world, I hope you find valuable information and interesting insights here on my blog. Feel free to share your opinions and questions in the comments section, I am always willing to chat and learn more.

Additionally, you can find me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasstofaleti)** and on **[Github](https://github.com/lucas-stofaleti)**. Feel free to follow and connect with me on these platforms.
